This is a templating class m currently tryin to work on.
It its main role is to handle the applicatio route dynamics for links among others.

i will need help and support but 
i will do what i can

. The class name is stpHtml.
It has several functions that can be used to layout a page.
development is still in progress.


to use: 
1. require the stp.php file in ur script

	1 e. g.
		require_once 'stp.php';


2. create a new instance of any of the html class controls when u want to use    it.

	2 e. g.
		$html = new stpHtml;
		$forms = new stpForms;
		etc.

stp.php can be manually edited to get access to other template controlers.
